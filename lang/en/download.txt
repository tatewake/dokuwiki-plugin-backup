**Backup complete!**

**Notes**:
  * Older backups are **never deleted**; it is up to you to delete them if you so choose.
  * The final backup file is named //dw-backup-YearMonthDay-HourMinuteSecond.tar.bz2//, and time is in **24 hour format**.
    * The file is formatted this way so that backups will **always** be sorted correctly. I suggest you not change this, but it's up to you.
